# Building a Drag & Drop Trello Board

This repo is for learning purposes in order to dig in with drag & drop stuff in order to apply it in production real world apps.

Mostly the same as seen in the course with a few differences in configuration and project setup like adding ESLint, Prettier and some settings and extensions recommendations for VSCode.

Scaffolding done with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

🧑🏻‍💻 For a better DX remember to install recommended extension which should be suggested by VSCode (as we have a *.vscode/extensions.json* file)
## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm run dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm run build

# yarn
yarn build

# bun
bun run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm run preview

# yarn
yarn preview

# bun
bun run preview
```
